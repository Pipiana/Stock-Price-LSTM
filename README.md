This project was undertaken as an individual endeavor for the fourth-semester midterm exam,
aimed at fulfilling the assessment requirements of the Deep Learning course. The primary goal
was to explore and manipulate time series data to predict stock prices by modifying the LSTM 
baseline model specified in the project guidelines.

The project successfully enhanced the stock price prediction model by modifying the LSTM baseline.
The modifications resulted in a model that outperformed the baseline regarding key metrics,
specifically the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

Key tasks accomplished during the project include:
1. Stock price data exploration to understand trends, patterns, and potential feature arrangement.
2. Normalization of stock price data to ensure uniformity and preparatory suitability for input into the LSTM model.
3. Implementation of the initial LSTM baseline model by specified project guidelines.
4. Experimentation with modifications to the baseline LSTM model to enhance its predictive capabilities 
by varying the number of neurons/units, testing diverse activation functions, and assessing the impact of 
including or excluding dropout layers within the model architecture.
