This project was undertaken as an individual endeavor for the fourth-semester midterm exam,
aimed at fulfilling the assessment requirements of the Deep Learning course. The primary goal
was to explore and manipulate time series data to predict stock prices by modifying the LSTM and Transformer
baseline model specified in the project guidelines.

The project was completed in two days. Both modified models have successfully outperformed the baseline models
regarding key metrics, specifically the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Key tasks accomplished during the project include:
1. Stock price data exploration to understand trends, patterns, and potential feature arrangement.
2. Normalization of stock price data to ensure uniformity and preparatory suitability for input into both models.
3. Implementation of the initial LSTM baseline model by specified project guidelines.
4. (LSTM Model)
   Experimentation with modifications to the baseline LSTM by varying the number of neurons/units, testing diverse activation functions,
   and assessing the impact of including or excluding dropout layers within the model architecture.
   (Transformer Model)
   Experimentation with modifications to the baseline Tranformer by adding dropout layer due the overfitting indication.
